-------------------------------

Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

- added autoscrolling of long file names
- fixed launching games with $ in filename (eg. "WarioWare, Inc. - Mega Microgame$! (USA).gba")
- documented "/.userdata/auto.sh" (see updated README.txt)

-------------------------------

===============================
upload v0.0.3 to github release
add libvorbis and libmad to non-arm miyoomini-toolchain-buildroot
and upload comparable v0.0.3 there too
for now I'm running the toolchain with a local v0.0.3 for vvvvvv
===============================

- add MGBA.pak and SUPA.pak to extras?
	- or add officially?
		- remove SFC.pak from extras if so
		- could then add SGB to extras (using mgba)

- add Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo to extras Tools

- SDL
	- put libmsettings behind a build flag or dlopen/dlsym

- can virtual boy be optimized at all?
	- add frameskip?
		- tada! 39fps and stuttery audio to 50fps with skip-free audio
		- seems tempermental, sometimes a restart fixes framerate

- quicksave and power off when /tmp/battery hits 5?
	change message when performing emergency power off
	maybe handle in keymon? then signal picoarch to shutdown

- revisit defaults and overrides for gambatte and mgba
	- mgba needs rumble strength setting

	- move all picoarch userdata folders into: 
		.picoarch/EMU_TAG/CORE_NAME/
	- still?

- picoarch
	hold to ff?
		can't figure it out
	allow audio while ff?
		possible but after trying not actually desireable...

- pcsx is going through some serious changes (besides the update to v2 options)
	wait for the dust to settle before considering updating

- test supafaust
	- msu-1
	- marvelous

- script checking core repos for newer commits?

- look at the way eggs clockd works and see if we can do something similar to add libmmenu to standalones
	- launch binary and pass its pid to standalonemenu which listens for MENU and sends a sig STOP to the previous binary?

- add an Extended Font.pak?

- picoarch
	truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends
	integrate cheat support into MiniUI

- look into CamOS and MI_ERRs in MiniUI and picoarch
	- probably tied to both settings and SDL trying to restore audio volume?
	- add logging to try to bookend the errors to identify their source then untangle the cause

- look into removing trimui patches from picoarch cores, breaking on latest core commits, see pcsx_rearmed

- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
	tried but didn't work
		git submodule set-branch -b miniui-miyoomini third-party/picoarch
	maybe
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777854/how-can-i-specify-a-branch-tag-when-adding-a-git-submodule/18799234#18799234
		this worked for everything but SDL I think

- faqs
- known issues

- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?

- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

- show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
